# Daily Rewards
Reward your players after a configured cooldown runs out.

I appreciate your interest in the Daily Rewards plugin. This is a project originally started by Halflove, and updated with love for 1.17.1. I don't know for how long I'll carry his torch, as my idea was to just update this for my own server. However, I wished to distribute it as there was demand for it since a Minecraft update broke the plugin.

Thank you,

RAWRMaD, Halflove
